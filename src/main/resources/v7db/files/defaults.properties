## global settings


# HTTP port
http.port = 8080

# Log4j
# A1 and V7 are built-in appenders that log to stdout
# v7files itself logs to V7, the libraries it uses log to A1
# if you want to configure something else, please define a new appender
log4j.rootLogger=INFO, A1
log4j.logger.v7db.files=INFO, V7


# Passwords and roles for the "demo" authentication provider
# If enabled (see "auth.provider"), defines the passwords and roles
# for the user who can authenticate
# (disabled by default, useful mostly for testing and demonstration)

auth.demo.user.admin.password = admin
auth.demo.user.admin.roles = admins, users
auth.demo.user.demo.password = demo
auth.demo.user.demo.roles = users


## endpoint definitions

# WebDAV Endpoints: URL prefixes that get mapped into WebDAV folder hierarchies
# You can have multiple endpoints, separated by comma (e.g. "/one, /two")
webdav.endpoints = /

# By default, every endpoint URL prefix is used as the file id for
# the root folder in the V7Files filesystem for that endpoint
# for example, if your endpoint is "/webdav", a URL "/webdav/test.txt" would
# map to the file called "test.txt" under the folder "/webdav".
# With the following setting, you can change this root file id
# for every endpoint:

# /webdav.root = /x


## per-endpoint settings

# These settings can be configured with a different setting for each endpoint.
# If no per-endpoint setting is done, it defaults back to a global setting
# To set a per-endpoint configuration, prefix the key with "[endpointPrefix]."
# for example "mongo.db" becomes "/webdav.mongo.db"

# How to connect to the database server (or cluster)
db.uri = mongodb://0.0.0.0:27017

# MongoDB database name
mongo.db = test


# HTTP Authentication Security Realm
auth.realm = V7Files


# WebDAV locking
# proper locking is not (yet) implemented, but the OS X Finder wants to have it,
# otherwise it will only mount the share read-only
# you can enable "fake" locking (which does not really do anything) 
#locking.provider = fake


# Authorisation provider

# default provider uses ACL specified in the database for every file
acl.provider = acl

# "global" if you want all files to share the same ACL set as properties (see below)
#acl.provider = global

# "trusted": everyone can do anything. 
# useful if you have a proxy in front of v7files managing permissions
#acl.provider = trusted

# access permissions for the endpoint's root file id
# you should be setting those in the database itself (on a per-file basis)
# however, for simple scenarios, you may not want to do that
# in this case, you can set them here
# they will override any permissions set in the database
# (and if child files do not specify anything themselves, they will inherit
# them as well), but only for the root file itself

#acl.read = anonymous
#acl.open = anonymous
#acl.write = role1, role2, user1, group2

# Authentication provider
# by default, authentication is disabled
# (this means only anonymous access is available, which
# is also disabled by default, see "auth.anonymous"

# the "demo" authentication provider uses password and role definition
# set as properties, with some defaults to be used for quick
# demonstrations or testing

#auth.provider = demo

# the "trusted" authentication provider relies on authentication
# having been performed by a proxy server in front to v7files
# and just trusts the user and role names passed as HTTP headers

#auth.provider = trusted

# anonymous access
# if set, allow anonymous access and use the given role name to check permissions
# if not set (the default) authentication is required

#auth.anonymous = anonymous


# Multi-tenant mode
# If you place an endpoint in multi-tenant mode,
# it will use a different MongoDB database for every tenant
# (these databases and the "v7files" collection must already exist)


# Single tenant (the default) uses the database specified by "mongo.db"
v7files.tenants = single

# "path"-based multi-tenant mode uses the first path segment of the endpoint url
# as the tenant name (= database name), the document root will start after that

#v7files.tenants = path
