   storage is counted against the DAV:quota-available-bytes.

   Note that there may be a number of distinct but overlapping sets of
   resources for which a DAV:quota-used-bytes is maintained (e.g., "all
   files with a given owner", "all files with a given group owner",
   etc.).  The server is at liberty to choose any of those sets but
   SHOULD do so in a repeatable way.  The rule may be configured per
   repository.

    /**
     * From the spec:
     *
     The DAV:quota-available-bytes property value is the value in octets
   representing the amount of additional disk space beyond the current
   allocation that can be allocated to this resource before further
   allocations will be refused.  It is understood that this space may be
   consumed by allocations to other resources.

   Support for this property is REQUIRED on collections, and OPTIONAL on
   other resources.  A server SHOULD implement this property for each
   resource that has the DAV:quota-used-bytes property.

   Clients SHOULD expect that as the DAV:quota-available-bytes on a
   resource approaches 0, further allocations to that resource may be
   refused.  A value of 0 indicates that users will probably not be able
   to perform operations that write additional information (e.g., a PUT
   inside a collection), but may be able to replace through overwrite an
   existing resource of equal size.
