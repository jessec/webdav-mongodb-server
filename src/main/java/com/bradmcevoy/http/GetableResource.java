     * The contentType argument is that which was resolved by negotiation in
     * the getContentType method. HTTP allows a given resource to have multiple
     * representations on the same URL. For example, a data series could be retrieved
     * as a chart as SVG, PNG, JPEG, or as text as CSV or XML. When the user agent
     * requests the resource is specified what content types it can accept. These
     * are matched against those that can be provided by the server and a preferred
     * representation is selected. That contentType is set in the response header
     * and is provided here so that the resource implementation can render itself
     * appropriately.
